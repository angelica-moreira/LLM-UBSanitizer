	 * another task tries to use the FPU for the 1st time, the FPUDIS
	 * trap handling (see arch/sh/kernel/cpu/sh5/fpu.c) will save the
	 * existing FPU state to the FP regs field within
	 * last_task_used_math before re-loading the new task's FPU state
	 * (or initialising it if the FPU has been used before).  So if
	 * last_task_used_math is stale, and its page has already been
	 * re-allocated for another use, the consequences are rather
	 * grim. Unless we null it here, there is no other path through
	 * which it would get safely nulled.
