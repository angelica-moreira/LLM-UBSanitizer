	 * render_basic config but hopefully it covers the maximum
	 * configuration latency.
	 *
	 * As a fallback, the checks in _append_oa_reports() to skip
	 * invalid OA reports do also seem to work to discard reports
	 * generated before this config has completed - albeit not
	 * silently.
	 *
	 * Unfortunately this is essentially a magic number, since we
	 * don't currently know of a reliable mechanism for predicting
	 * how long the MUX config will take to apply and besides
	 * seeing invalid reports we don't know of a reliable way to
	 * explicitly check that the MUX config has landed.
	 *
	 * It's even possible we've miss characterized the underlying
	 * problem - it just seems like the simplest explanation why
	 * a delay at this location would mitigate any invalid reports.
