	 * Without an explicit full barrier speculative LOAD on line 8 can
	 * be executed before CPU#0 does STORE on line 1.  If that happens,
	 * CPU#0 observes the PENDING bit is still set and new execution of
	 * a @work is not queued in a hope, that CPU#1 will eventually
	 * finish the queued @work.  Meanwhile CPU#1 does not see
	 * event_indicated is set, because speculative LOAD was executed
	 * before actual STORE.
