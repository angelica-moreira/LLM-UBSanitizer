	 * CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START) and supplying an alternate DTB.
	 * If we detect this condition, we need to move the MIPS exception
	 * vectors up to an area that we own.
	 *
	 * This is distinct from the OTHER special case mentioned in
	 * smp-bmips.c (boot on TP1, but enable SMP, then TP0 becomes our
	 * logical CPU#1).  For the Viper TP1 case, SMP is off limits.
	 *
	 * Also note that many BMIPS435x CPUs do not have a
	 * BMIPS_RELO_VECTOR_CONTROL_1 register, so it isn't safe to just
	 * write VMLINUX_LOAD_ADDRESS into that register on every SoC.
