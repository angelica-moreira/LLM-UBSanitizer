	/* The lower level RTC driver may return -1 in some fields,

	 *
	 *   - The hardware may not be capable of filling them in;
	 *     many alarms match only on time-of-day fields, not
	 *     day/month/year calendar data.
	 *
	 *   - Some hardware uses illegal values as "wildcard" match
	 *     values, which non-Linux firmware (like a BIOS) may try
	 *     to set up as e.g. "alarm 15 minutes after each hour".
	 *     Linux uses only oneshot alarms.
	 *
	 * When we see that here, we deal with it by using values from
	 * a current RTC timestamp for any missing (-1) values.  The
	 * RTC driver prevents "periodic alarm" modes.
	 *
	 * But this can be racey, because some fields of the RTC timestamp
	 * may have wrapped in the interval since we read the RTC alarm,
	 * which would lead to us inserting inconsistent values in place
	 * of the -1 fields.
	 *
	 * Reading the alarm and timestamp in the reverse sequence
	 * would have the same race condition, and not solve the issue.
	 *
	 * So, we must first read the RTC timestamp,
	 * then read the RTC alarm value,
	 * and then read a second RTC timestamp.
	 *
	 * If any fields of the second timestamp have changed
	 * when compared with the first timestamp, then we know
	 * our timestamp may be inconsistent with that used by
	 * the low-level rtc_read_alarm_internal() function.
	 *
	 * So, when the two timestamps disagree, we just loop and do
	 * the process again to get a fully consistent set of values.
	 *
	 * This could all instead be done in the lower level driver,
	 * but since more than one lower level RTC implementation needs it,
	 * then it's probably best best to do it here instead of there..
