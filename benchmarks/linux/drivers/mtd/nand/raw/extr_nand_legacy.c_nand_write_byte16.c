	 *
	 *    When the host supports a 16-bit bus width, only data is
	 *    transferred at the 16-bit width. All address and command line
	 *    transfers shall use only the lower 8-bits of the data bus. During
	 *    command transfers, the host may place any value on the upper
	 *    8-bits of the data bus. During address transfers, the host shall
	 *    set the upper 8-bits of the data bus to 00h.
	 *
	 * One user of the write_byte callback is nand_set_features. The
	 * four parameters are specified to be written to I/O[7:0], but this is
	 * neither an address nor a command transfer. Let's assume a 0 on the
	 * upper I/O lines is OK.
