	 * The bit_shift for a mc_filter_type of 0 represents the number of
	 * left-shifts where the MSB of mc_addr[5] would still fall within
	 * the hash_mask.  Case 0 does this exactly.  Since there are a total
	 * of 8 bits of shifting, then mc_addr[4] will shift right the
	 * remaining number of bits. Thus 8 - bit_shift.  The rest of the
	 * cases are a variation of this algorithm...essentially raising the
	 * number of bits to shift mc_addr[5] left, while still keeping the
	 * 8-bit shifting total.
	 *
	 * For example, given the following Destination MAC Address and an
	 * mta register count of 128 (thus a 4096-bit vector and 0xFFF mask),
	 * we can see that the bit_shift for case 0 is 4.  These are the hash
