	 * This is a huge hack to workaround a problem where the dw_hdmi i2c
	 * bus could sometimes get wedged.  Once wedged there doesn't appear
	 * to be any way to unwedge it (including the HDMI_I2CM_SOFTRSTZ)
	 * other than pulsing the SDA line.
	 *
	 * We appear to be able to pulse the SDA line (in the eyes of dw_hdmi)
	 * by:
	 * 1. Remux the pin as a GPIO output, driven low.
	 * 2. Wait a little while.  1 ms seems to work, but we'll do 10.
	 * 3. Immediately jump to remux the pin as dw_hdmi i2c again.
	 *
	 * At the moment of remuxing, the line will still be low due to its
	 * recent stint as an output, but then it will be pulled high by the
	 * (presumed) external pullup.  dw_hdmi seems to see this as a rising
	 * edge and that seems to get it out of its jam.
	 *
	 * This wedging was only ever seen on one TV, and only on one of
	 * its HDMI ports.  It happened when the TV was powered on while the
	 * device was plugged in.  A scope trace shows the TV bringing both SDA
	 * and SCL low, then bringing them both back up at roughly the same
	 * time.  Presumably this confuses dw_hdmi because it saw activity but
	 * no real STOP (maybe it thinks there's another master on the bus?).
	 * Giving it a clean rising edge of SDA while SCL is already high
	 * presumably makes dw_hdmi see a STOP which seems to bring dw_hdmi out
	 * of its stupor.
	 *
	 * Note that after coming back alive, transfers seem to immediately
	 * resume, so if we unwedge due to a timeout we should wait a little
	 * longer for our transfer to finish, since it might have just started
	 * now.
